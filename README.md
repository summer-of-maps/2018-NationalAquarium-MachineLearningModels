# National-Aquarium
This project analyzes spatial patterns in marine debris composition in the mid-Atlantic region to better inform and target future reduction efforts. Understanding the types of marine debris most commonly found in our local ecosystems (e.g. single-use plastics) and their spatial patterns will tell us what types of products and geographical areas on which the National Aquarium and its partners can most effectively focus our reduction efforts. We can then relate the debris data to the surrounding factors that contribute to the identified patterns, including population size, land use, economic factors, degree of urbanization, and existence of debris-related legislation. Displaying these correlations visually on a map will elucidate their relationships (or lack thereof) and help determine where reduction efforts would be most effective, helping partners to make the most efficient use of limited resources.
